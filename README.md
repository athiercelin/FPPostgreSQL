# FPPostgreSQL
FPPostgreSQL is the very first-ever made cocoa framework for postgresql. Build by Flying Pig, it was private until today.
Flying Pig no longer provides support for the framework and the source is delivered as is.

We will be working in the future on cleaning up this repo to make it easier for developers to use the framework.
