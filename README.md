# FPPostgreSQL
FPPostgreSQL is the very first-ever made cocoa framework for postgresql. Build by Flying Pig, it was private until today.
Flying Pig no longer provides support for the framework and the source is delivered as is.

We will be working in the future on cleaning up this repo to make it easier for developers to use the framework.

I'm keeping this repo as it was when under FP with no intention to edit it. I will rewrite a fresh framework in swift later. Feel free to use and edit this one in the mean time - AT
